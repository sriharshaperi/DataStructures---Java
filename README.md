# DataStructures-Java
Following concepts of data structures and algorithms have been covered using Java : 

1. Arrays (1d and 2d).

2. Linked Lists. (Linear and Circular)
    -> Single Linked List
    -> Double Linked List
    
3. Stack. (Array and linked list implementation)
4. Queue. (Array and linked list implementation)

5. Trees( Array and linked list implementation )
    -> Binary Trees
    -> Binary Search Trees
    -> AVL Trees
    
6. Heaps
    -> Max Heap
    -> Min Heap
    
7. Graphs
     -> Implementations using Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix
     -> BFS
     -> DFS
     -> Topological Sort
     -> Shortest Path using BFS, DFS.
     -> Dijkstra's Algorithm
     -> All paths (shortest and longest) using Directed Acyclic Graph
     -> Detecting cycles in graphs
     
8. Dynamic Programming
     -> Knapsack based problems
     -> Optimal Subsolution based problems
